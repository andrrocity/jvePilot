# FCA Hybrid OpenPilot/ACC v0.8.1
I have a 2018 Grand Cherokee Trailhawk, so I'm only able to confirm features using this vehicle.
@debugged-hosting has confirmed it to work on a 2017 Gas Chrysler Pacifica

## What is this Fork?
This fork combines the speed control logic of OpenPilot with the vehicles Adaptive Cruse Control (ACC).
It does this by changing the ACC speed to match the value OpenPilot calculates as the desired speed.
This brings some of OpenPilots longitudinal control to these vehicles.
Including things like slowing while cornering and slowing when it detects cut-ins.
It will also smooth the breaking of ACC when driving in traffic.

### How it does it
Currently, on FCA vehicles, only the steering is controlled by OpenPilot and speed is left up to the ACC of the vehicle.
This fork takes control of the ACC speed setting and adjusts the ACC speed to match the speed OpenPilot would be targeting if it actually was able to control the gas and breaks.
It does this by simulating ACC+ and ACC- button presses on the steering wheel to change the ACC speed.
It is limited as ACC only goes down to 20 mph so it doesn't help as low speeds.
Though, I would argue ACC does a decent job at slower speeds anyway.

### Features
* Automatically changes ACC speed resulting in an improvement in breaking smoothness over the built in ACC
* Smother driving in traffic as OpenPilot will do a better job at slowing for traffic
* Slow for cars cutting in before ACC does
* Slow in turns so you don't have to change the ACC speed yourself
* Supports the 4 distance settings of ACC (by changing radar values reported to OpenPilot)
* Easy camera offset changing

### How to use it 
When using this branch, you will be setting the max ACC speed on the OpenPilot display instead of the one in the dashboard.
OpenPilot will then set the ACC setting in the dashboard to the targeted speed, but never exceeding the max speed set on the OpenPilot display.
A quick press of the ACC+ and ACC- buttons will change this speed by 5 mph on the OpenPilot display, while a long deliberate press (about a 1/2 second press) changes it by 1 mph.
DO NOT hold the ACC+ or ACC- buttons for longer that a 1 second. Either make quick or long deliberate presses only.

#### Where to look when setting ACC speed
Do not look at the dashboard when setting your ACC max speed.
Instead, only look at the one on the OpenPilot display.
The reason you need to look at OpenPilot is because OpenPilot will be changing the one in the dashboard.
It will be adjusting it as needed, never raising it above the one set on the OpenPilot display.

**ONLY look at the MAX speed on OpenPilot when setting the ACC speed instead of the dashboard!**

# Install
## Branches
`/hacc-release` - The latest release.  Will contain the latest version I feel is ready for general use.

---
# Customizing
`opParms` is a handy tool to change parameters without diving into any json files or code.
First, ssh in to your EON and make sure you're in `/data/openpilot`, then start `opEdit`:
```python
cd /data/openpilot
python op_edit.py  # or ./op_edit.py
```

### `camera_offset`, Default: `0.06`, Live!
Your camera offset to use in lane_planner.py.
Helps fix lane hugging

### `slow_in_turns`, Default: `True`, Live!
Should OpenPilot slow down when in a curve?
### `slow_in_turns_ratio`, Default: `1.0`, Live!
Adjust how much slowing occurs in a curve.
Example: Setting this to `1.2` will cause OpenPilot to drive 20% faster in turns than if it was set to the default `1.0`.
### `slow_in_turns_rotate`, Default: `0`, Live!
Rotate speed drop-off angle. 
Example: Setting this to `0.004` will stretch the plot by 10 mph.
Use this if the vehicle slows too much in curves when driving at faster speeds.

#### Plot examples when changing `slow_in_turns_rotate`
THESE ARE EXAMPLES, don't pay much attention to the actual numbers
Below are two example plots showing how the rotate parameter works.  
The y-axis is the top speed for the curve.  The x-axis is the current speed of the vehicle.
The red line plots the max speed to current speed.

Here is the plot showing the max speeds for a given road curvature when `slow_in_turns_rotate` is set to 0

![](https://github.com/j-vanetten/jvePilot/blob/feature/curve-speed-tweak-param/common/images/curve-speed-0.000.jpg)

Here is the plot showing the max speeds for a given road curvature when `slow_in_turns_rotate` is set to 0.013 
(I used a high number to exaggerate the graph, you'll probably don't want it set this high)
As you can see, the speed drop off in the curve is now at a much higher speed.

### `disengage_on_gas`, Default: `True`
Should OpenPilot disengage when the gas pedal is pressed?
Stock ACC doesn't deactivate when pressing on the gas. Disable this option to make OpenPilot act more like stock ACC.
**NOTE: This broke for me as of v0.8 of OpenPilot as it causes a LKAS fault when you press the gas while OpenPilot is active.
I have left it as an option as I plan to look into fixing it or it may work on other vehicles.
If you have issues setting this to `False`, just set it back to `True`**

### `acc_button_long_press`, Default: `30`, Live!
Number of centiseconds to consider a button as long pressed.  (30 = .30 seconds)
Quick pressing the ACC+ and ACC- buttons results in 5 mph changes to the set max speed.
This allows you to quickly change speeds when the speed limit changes.
But, when you get to the speed limit, sometime you want if you want to change by 1 mph to fine tune the speed you really want.
This is accomplished by doing long deliberate presses.
With the default value of 30, pressing teh ACC+ or ACC- buttons for .3 seconds or more will result in a 1 mph change.
DO NOT hold the buttons down long that 1 second as that will interfere with the OpenPilot controlled ACC setting.

### Lead Distance Ratio
The lead distance ratios are the ratio to adjust the distance OpenPilot follows based on the follow distance selected.
This is done by adjusting the reported radar distance to the lead car.
Having a ratio set to 2.6 causes this fork to report the lead car as being 2.6 times further away that it actually is.
Causing openPilot to move closer to that car.  NOTE: It's impossible to get closer than what ACC will allow.
The default values are what worked for me to get OpenPilot to be close to the ACC distance while still allowing ACC be the limiting factor to the distance.
#### `lead_distance_ratio_1bar`, Default: `1.1`, Live!
Ratio to adjust OpenPilot's default model distance when ACC follow distance is set to 1 bar
#### `lead_distance_ratio_2bars`, Default: `1.5`, Live!
Ratio to adjust OpenPilot's default model distance when ACC follow distance is set to 2 bars
#### `lead_distance_ratio_3bars`, Default: `2.1`, Live!
Ratio to adjust OpenPilot's default model distance when ACC follow distance is set to 3 bars
#### `lead_distance_ratio_4bars`, Default: `2.6`, Live!
Ratio to adjust OpenPilot's default model distance when ACC follow distance is set to 4 bars

---

### **Safety Notes** 
* This is my experimental branch, so I'm not responsible for any damage this may cause to
* OpenPilot still does not have direct control of the gas and breaks!
Changing the ACC speed does not always result in the vehicle breaking unless the difference in speed is large enough.
If the speed difference is small, the vehicle just lets off the gas.
* ACC can't go slower that 20mph

What is openpilot?
------

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of supported [car makes, models and model years](#supported-cars). In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers.

Integration with Stock Features
------

In all supported cars:
* Stock Lane Keep Assist (LKA) and stock ALC are replaced by openpilot ALC, which only functions when openpilot is engaged by the user.
* Stock LDW is replaced by openpilot LDW.

Additionally, on specific supported cars (see ACC column in [supported cars](#supported-cars)):
* Stock ACC is replaced by openpilot ACC.
* openpilot FCW operates in addition to stock FCW.

openpilot should preserve all other vehicle's stock features, including, but are not limited to: FCW, Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), auto high-beam, blind spot warning, and side collision warning.

Supported Hardware
------

At the moment, openpilot supports the [EON DevKit](https://comma.ai/shop/products/eon-dashcam-devkit) and the [comma two](https://comma.ai/shop/products/comma-two-devkit). A [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/products/car-harness) is recommended to connect the EON or comma two to the car. For experimental purposes, openpilot can also run on an Ubuntu computer with external [webcams](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/tools/webcam).

<sup>1</sup>Requires an [OBD-II car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/products/comma-car-harness) and [community built ASCM harness](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki/GM#hardware). ***NOTE: disconnecting the ASCM disables Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB).*** <br />

Although it's not upstream, there's a community of people getting openpilot to run on Tesla's [here](https://tinkla.us/)

Community Maintained Cars and Features are not verified by comma to meet our [safety model](SAFETY.md). Be extra cautious using them. They are only available after enabling the toggle in `Settings->Developer->Enable Community Features`.

To promote a car from community maintained, it must meet a few requirements. We must own one from the brand, we must sell the harness for it, has full ISO26262 in both panda and openpilot, there must be a path forward for longitudinal control, it must have AEB still enabled, and it must support fingerprinting 2.0

Installation Instructions
------

Install openpilot on an EON or comma two by entering ``https://openpilot.comma.ai`` during the installer setup.

Follow these [video instructions](https://youtu.be/lcjqxCymins) to properly mount the device on the windshield. Note: openpilot features an automatic pose calibration routine and openpilot performance should not be affected by small pitch and yaw misalignments caused by imprecise device mounting.

Before placing the device on your windshield, check the state and local laws and ordinances where you drive. Some state laws prohibit or restrict the placement of objects on the windshield of a motor vehicle.

You will be able to engage openpilot after reviewing the onboarding screens and finishing the calibration procedure.

Limitations of openpilot ALC and LDW
------

openpilot ALC and openpilot LDW do not automatically drive the vehicle or reduce the amount of attention that must be paid to operate your vehicle. The driver must always keep control of the steering wheel and be ready to correct the openpilot ALC action at all times.

While changing lanes, openpilot is not capable of looking next to you or checking your blind spot. Only nudge the wheel to initiate a lane change after you have confirmed it's safe to do so.

Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot ALC and openpilot LDW, causing them to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:

* Poor visibility (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions that may interfere with sensor operation.
* The road facing camera is obstructed, covered or damaged by mud, ice, snow, etc.
* Obstruction caused by applying excessive paint or adhesive products (such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.) onto the vehicle.
* The device is mounted incorrectly.
* When in sharp curves, like on-off ramps, intersections etc...; openpilot is designed to be limited in the amount of steering torque it can produce.
* In the presence of restricted lanes or construction zones.
* When driving on highly banked roads or in presence of strong cross-wind.
* Extremely hot or cold temperatures.
* Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).
* Driving on hills, narrow, or winding roads.

The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of openpilot components. It is the driver's responsibility to be in control of the vehicle at all times.

Limitations of openpilot ACC and FCW
------

openpilot ACC and openpilot FCW are not systems that allow careless or inattentive driving. It is still necessary for the driver to pay close attention to the vehicle’s surroundings and to be ready to re-take control of the gas and the brake at all times.

Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot ACC and openpilot FCW, causing them to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:

* Poor visibility (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions that may interfere with sensor operation.
* The road facing camera or radar are obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, etc.
* Obstruction caused by applying excessive paint or adhesive products (such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.) onto the vehicle.
* The device is mounted incorrectly.
* Approaching a toll booth, a bridge or a large metal plate.
* When driving on roads with pedestrians, cyclists, etc...
* In presence of traffic signs or stop lights, which are not detected by openpilot at this time.
* When the posted speed limit is below the user selected set speed. openpilot does not detect speed limits at this time.
* In presence of vehicles in the same lane that are not moving.
* When abrupt braking maneuvers are required. openpilot is designed to be limited in the amount of deceleration and acceleration that it can produce.
* When surrounding vehicles perform close cut-ins from neighbor lanes.
* Driving on hills, narrow, or winding roads.
* Extremely hot or cold temperatures.
* Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).
* Interference from other equipment that generates radar waves.

The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of openpilot components. It is the driver's responsibility to be in control of the vehicle at all times.

Limitations of openpilot DM
------

openpilot DM should not be considered an exact measurement of the alertness of the driver.

Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot DM, causing it to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:

* Low light conditions, such as driving at night or in dark tunnels.
* Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).
* The driver's face is partially or completely outside field of view of the driver facing camera.
* The driver facing camera is obstructed, covered, or damaged.

The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of openpilot components. A driver should not rely on openpilot DM to assess their level of attention.

User Data and comma Account
------

By default, openpilot uploads the driving data to our servers. You can also access your data by pairing with the comma connect app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/comma-connect/id1456551889), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.comma.connect&hl=en_US)). We use your data to train better models and improve openpilot for everyone.

openpilot is open source software: the user is free to disable data collection if they wish to do so.

openpilot logs the road facing camera, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs.
The driver facing camera is only logged if you explicitly opt-in in settings. The microphone is not recorded.

By using openpilot, you agree to [our Privacy Policy](https://my.comma.ai/privacy). You understand that use of this software or its related services will generate certain types of user data, which may be logged and stored at the sole discretion of comma. By accepting this agreement, you grant an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to comma for the use of this data.

Safety and Testing
----

* openpilot observes ISO26262 guidelines, see [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md) for more detail.
* openpilot has software in the loop [tests](.github/workflows/test.yaml) that run on every commit.
* The safety model code lives in panda and is written in C, see [code rigor](https://github.com/commaai/panda#code-rigor) for more details.
* panda has software in the loop [safety tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/tree/master/tests/safety).
* Internally, we have a hardware in the loop Jenkins test suite that builds and unit tests the various processes.
* panda has additional hardware in the loop [tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/blob/master/Jenkinsfile).
* We run the latest openpilot in a testing closet containing 10 EONs continuously replaying routes.

Testing on PC
------
For simplified development and experimentation, openpilot can be run in the CARLA driving simulator, which allows you to develop openpilot without a car. The whole setup should only take a few minutes.

Steps:
1) Start the CARLA server on first terminal
```
bash -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commaai/openpilot/master/tools/sim/start_carla.sh)"
```
2) Start openpilot on second terminal
```
bash -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commaai/openpilot/master/tools/sim/start_openpilot_docker.sh)"
```
3) Press 1 to engage openpilot

See the full [README](tools/sim/README.md)

You should also take a look at the tools directory in master: lots of tools you can use to replay driving data, test, and develop openpilot from your PC.


Community and Contributing
------

openpilot is developed by [comma](https://comma.ai/) and by users like you. We welcome both pull requests and issues on [GitHub](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot). Bug fixes and new car ports are encouraged.

You can add support for your car by following guides we have written for [Brand](https://medium.com/@comma_ai/how-to-write-a-car-port-for-openpilot-7ce0785eda84) and [Model](https://medium.com/@comma_ai/openpilot-port-guide-for-toyota-models-e5467f4b5fe6) ports. Generally, a car with adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist is a good candidate. [Join our Discord](https://discord.comma.ai) to discuss car ports: most car makes have a dedicated channel.
